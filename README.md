To use this script just give execution perms: chmod +x ./installDocker.sh

Use this script with 1 parameter which is the user you are using with docker to add it to the Docker group so you won't need to use Docker with root privileges.

Run this script as root since you need to install packages

Usage example: sudo ./installDocker.sh marti
